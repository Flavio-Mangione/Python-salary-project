Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of salary trends in two rapidly evolving fields: Cyber Security and Data Science. Utilizing datasets containing salary information from various countries, the analysis explores multiple aspects such as geographical salary distribution, the impact of experience levels and company sizes on salaries, and the correlation between remote work and compensation.

Datasets
The analysis is based on two primary datasets:

Cyber Security Salaries: Contains information about salaries in the field of Cyber Security across various countries, company sizes, and experience levels.
Data Science Salaries: Consists of data regarding salaries in the Data Science domain, detailing similar attributes for comparison.
Features
The project involves several key components:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Standardizing country names using the pycountry library and filtering the datasets to include only common geographical locations for a fair comparison.

Descriptive Analysis: Summarizing the key statistics of both datasets.

Salary Comparison: Investigating how salaries vary based on factors like experience level and company size.

Geographical Analysis: Comparing the distribution of salaries across different countries and regions, especially focusing on Europe and the United States.

Remote Work Analysis: Examining the relationship between remote working ratios and salary levels in both fields.


The project utilizes various types of visualizations to present the findings:

Correlation Matrices: To understand the relationships between different numerical variables in the datasets.

Bar Charts and Boxplots: For comparing average salaries across different categories like experience levels and company sizes.

Geographical Maps: Using Geopandas to visualize the global distribution of employees in both Cyber Security and Data Science fields.

Tools and Libraries Used

Pandas and Geopandas: For data manipulation and geographical data handling.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

PyCountry: For country code standardization and conversion.

Conclusions

This project sheds light on various factors influencing salary structures in Cyber Security and Data Science, providing valuable insights for professionals and stakeholders in these fields.
